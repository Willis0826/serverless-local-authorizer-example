# serverless local authorizer example

This project demos how to use Serverless Framework with Lambda Authorizer locally for REST APIs (API Gateway V1).


## Requirement

1. Nodejs 20

Run the following command to install packages.

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Start Dev Server

Wicked, you can start serverless dev server locally and test the result.

```bash
$ npm run start
$ curl -H "Authorization: abc" http://localhost:3000/dev/ping
```

Now, you should get a response `pong` after you sent a GET request to `/ping`. Please note, you must provide `Authorization` header in the request in order to pass Lambda Authorizer.

If you send a request without `Authorization` header, you will get a response `{"message":"Unauthorized"}`.

üç∫ Cheers, that's all. You can enjoy the seamless Lambda development with TypeScript locally.
